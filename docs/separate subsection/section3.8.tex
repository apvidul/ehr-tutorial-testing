\section{difference of EMRs describe habit}

\paragraph{Many hospitals now have outlines and templates in order to standardize electronic medical record documents. Therefore, when writing a case, it is not necessary for the doctor to write word by word, and there is a corresponding template to choose from. The same hospital should have the same structure. But putting together EMR samples from different hospitals makes a difference. The descriptions are different and the ratings are different.\\
\\For example, some hospitals describe the situation of consciousness only as coma. But there are also three similar but different states, like syncope and shock.
\\Coma has three stages, mild, moderate, and deep.
In such a situation, during preprocessing, several representations should be counted first, and finally these degrees should be sorted according to clinical prior knowledge and then quantified.}
